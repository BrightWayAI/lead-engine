# Changelog

All notable changes to lead-engine are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versions match `plugin.json`.

## [0.2.3] — Platform-agnostic Step 0 (2026-05-12)

### Changed
- **Setup command Step 0 now platform-agnostic.** Every `request_cowork_directory(...)` call is conditional: "In Cowork, call `request_cowork_directory(...)`. In Claude Code (or any environment with direct filesystem access), no mount is needed." Same plugin source works in both runtimes.

### Why this matters
Phase 0 of SECOND-BRAIN-V2-SPEC. Removes the implicit Cowork-only assumption so Claude Code users do not hit unsupported tool calls during setup.

## [0.2.0] — Config-root refactor + contact-researcher

### Changed (config-root refactor)
- **All writable plugin data moved to a user-chosen folder.** User-context, pipeline, sent-log, and pre-call briefs were previously stored under the plugin's source folder (which Cowork mounts read-only). Writes failed silently. They now live under `<config-root>/plugins/lead-engine.*`, where `<config-root>` is the folder the user chooses on first plugin setup (recorded at `~/Documents/.claude-plugin-config-root`):
  - `<config-root>/plugins/lead-engine.user-context.md` (was `references/user-context.md`)
  - `<config-root>/plugins/lead-engine.pipeline.md` (was `references/pipeline.md`)
  - `<config-root>/plugins/lead-engine.sent-log.md` (was `references/sent-log.md`)
  - `<config-root>/plugins/lead-engine.briefs/SIG-*.md` (was `references/briefs/`)
- **Read-only plugin reference files stay where they are** — `references/seven-signals.md`, `references/voice-rules.md`, `references/rollout-plan.md` continue to load from the plugin's source folder (they don't need to be writable).
- **`/lead-setup` gets Step 0** — resolves the config root via the pointer; prompts for it on first run; reads shared identity (`<config-root>/identity.md`) and voice (`<config-root>/voice.md`); offers to migrate legacy `~/Documents/Claude/identity.md`/`voice.md` and any pre-staged plugin configs.
- **All `/lead-*` commands updated** to read/write the new paths.
- **User-facing prompts and skill descriptions debranded** for fork-friendliness.

### Added (previously in-flight)
- `contact-researcher` subagent — single-contact deep dive across CRM, email, calendar, web. Returns a structured dossier (Contact Snapshot / Relationship History / Recent Public Signals / Three Talking Points / Suggested Next Step / Confidence). Used internally by `/lead-brief` and `/lead-pull`, exposed for other plugins to delegate to.
- `/lead-brief` and `/lead-pull` now delegate to `contact-researcher` with confidence-aware gating — pause on Low confidence and ask the user for context before proceeding.

## [0.1.0] — Initial release

### Added
- Intent-based LinkedIn outbound system with seven slash commands: `/lead-setup`, `/lead-pull`, `/lead-capture`, `/lead-warm`, `/lead-connect`, `/lead-draft`, `/lead-pipeline`, `/lead-log`, `/lead-brief`.
- The 7-signal taxonomy (engagement, job change, funding, hiring, growth/expansion, tech-stack change, direct intent) for classifying buying signals.
- The 27-word opener pattern for first-touch DMs.
- Apollo MCP integration for pulling job-change / funding / hiring signals at ICP scale.
- HubSpot (or other CRM) integration via `/lead-log` for pipeline + lifecycle stage tracking.
- Voice-faithful drafting using user-context-captured banned phrases and 3-touch cadence logic.
- Reference files: `seven-signals.md`, `voice-rules.md`, `pipeline.md`, `sent-log.md`, `rollout-plan.md`.
